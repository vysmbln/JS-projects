### Challenges:

>***How to generate the maze?***
by Using an algorithm to generate a maze. We will learn about data structure + recursion to implement simplest algorithm


>***How to draw the maze on the screen?***
by using MatterJS to draw maze


>***How to make some keyboard to control the ball?***
MatterJS has the ablity to map press movement to shapes

>***How to detect when the ball touch the green square***
MatterJS has the ability to detect collisions between different shapes and report back as an event


### BUILDING THE MAZE: 
1. Create index.html, index.js //Add matter.js cdn and index.js on index.html.

2. On index.js add: 

- [x]  require objects from matter.js library(Engine, Render, Runner, World, Bodies) so we can use them on the file.

- [x] add the canvas
- [x] add the walls

3. Create a layout for the maze:
